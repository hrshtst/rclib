# User Guide

Welcome to the `rclib` User Guide. This guide will help you install the library, understand its core concepts, and build reservoir computing models for your applications.

## Introduction

`rclib` is a C++ based Reservoir Computing library with Python bindings. It offers high performance for training large-scale Echo State Networks (ESNs) and related architectures.

Key features include:
*   **Speed**: Heavy lifting is done in C++ using the Eigen library.
*   **Flexibility**: Mix and match different reservoir types and readout algorithms.
*   **Scalability**: Supports large sparse reservoirs and multi-threading.
